# Git workflow

Apply these defaults unless the user explicitly overrides them in the same
turn. A git request authorizes only the repository and forge state required for
that operation.

- Resolve the base from the remote default; never hardcode `main`.
- Before the first edit in any newly selected, created, or reused branch or
  worktree, require a clean worktree and fetch the remote default branch. Stop
  and report dirty files; never stash, commit, or discard them automatically.
- Create focused branches and worktrees directly from the freshly fetched
  remote default tip. Do not configure a focused branch to track the remote
  default; set its upstream only when pushing that focused branch.
- When entering an existing focused branch or worktree, merge the freshly
  fetched remote default before editing.
- Merge the remote base to update a branch. Never rebase.
- Stop and report merge conflicts; do not bypass or rewrite them.
- Never amend commits. Add a new commit for every correction.
- Never force-push. Stop if a plain push is rejected by divergent history.
- Stage only relevant files and exclude secrets or unrelated local work.
- Use concise Conventional Commit subjects in imperative mood.
- Let hooks run unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- Squash-merge pull requests and delete the source branch afterward.

After a squash merge, sync the local base and remove the merged local branch.
