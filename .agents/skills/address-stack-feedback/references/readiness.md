# Stack review readiness

Readiness belongs to the complete native stack selected by its repository-scoped
stack number. Lower members can be reviewed and covered without becoming
independently merge-ready.

## Member states

- `reviewed`: Required CI and every intentionally active review provider reached
  a terminal result for the member's exact head, and every returned finding
  surface was inspected and classified.
- `covered`: The member is reviewed and every finding is moot at the integrated
  top, satisfied by an exact descendant commit, fixed by an exact commit in a
  required top fix layer, or declined with accepted evidence. Every originating
  inline thread has a maintainer-workflow reply and is resolved.
- `pending`: Required CI, review, provider availability, thread handling,
  validation, or live-membership evidence is incomplete.
- `blocked`: A material decision, unsafe mutation, unresolved human judgment,
  invalid stack, unavailable required provider action, failed validation, or
  unexplained topology prevents safe convergence.

A covered lower member can still contain the reported flaw at its own head. Its
coverage therefore depends on every named fix layer above it and does not admit
a partial merge.

## Frozen members and invalidation

A member becomes frozen after its exact-head required CI and review are terminal
and every finding surface is classified. This workflow never pushes to a frozen
member.

- Appending one expected fix layer above an unchanged prefix preserves the
  prefix's evidence. The new member remains pending until reviewed and covered.
- A changed head at position N invalidates CI, review, validation, and coverage
  for position N and every descendant.
- A changed base, removed or reordered member, replaced stack identity, or
  unexplained stack closure invalidates from the first affected position. When
  no safe affected position can be established, invalidate the whole stack.
- An externally appended member does not rewrite the prefix, but it changes the
  confirmed scope. Adopt it only when current evidence proves it belongs to the
  stack claim; otherwise stop for scope resolution.
- A review, check, reply, or provider completion for a previous head never
  satisfies a current-head gate.

Use `scripts/stack_state.py inspect --expect <snapshot>` to distinguish an
unchanged stack, an append-only member, and invalidating topology or head drift.
Use its foreground `wait` operation only when stack change itself is the awaited
transition.

## Complete-stack ready gate

The complete stack is `ready` only when all conditions are simultaneously true:

- the final native snapshot has the same stack identity, base, order, and exact
  heads used by the final evidence pass;
- every current member is reviewed and covered;
- every required behavior has observed black-box evidence on the final
  integrated top tree;
- the declared project gate passed for that same final content;
- every member's required checks are terminal and successful;
- every intentionally active provider has terminal evidence for each head it
  was required to review;
- the newest fix layer has no actionable finding;
- every source and fix-layer thread has a maintainer-workflow reply;
- GitHub reports zero unresolved threads across the stack;
- no paid review capacity, bypass, or merge is required to claim readiness; and
- a final live-membership audit contains no unreviewed member.

Reviewing the initial member list, draining a trigger queue, fixing every known
finding, or obtaining a clean top review is insufficient by itself. Readiness is
the fixed point where all four agree: live native membership, exact heads,
finding coverage, and terminal provider evidence.

## Result meaning

`ready` applies only to the whole live stack and means it can be returned to its
caller for a separately authorized atomic merge. `pending` names the exact
transition or safe `retry_at`. `blocked` names the decision or failure that
cannot be resolved inside the current authority. This workflow never returns
`merged`.
