# Milestone Rush event ledger

The bundled one-shot command owns normalized event ingestion, validation, and
aggregation. It never polls, runs as a daemon, or wakes a model:

```bash
python3 milestone-rush/scripts/event_ledger.py ingest \
  --ledger .agent/milestone-rush-events.jsonl --input normalized-events.jsonl
python3 milestone-rush/scripts/event_ledger.py validate \
  --ledger .agent/milestone-rush-events.jsonl --run-id "$RUN_ID" --json
python3 milestone-rush/scripts/event_ledger.py summarize \
  --ledger .agent/milestone-rush-events.jsonl --run-id "$RUN_ID" --json
```

The ledger is append-only and ignored. Never stage or commit it. Preserve
earlier runs and distinguish them by stable `runId`. `ingest` writes only
validated schema-v2 events, treats a structurally identical repeated
`runId`/`eventId` pair as idempotent, and rejects a conflicting duplicate before
appending anything.

## Adapter boundary

Host integrations translate their native lifecycle and usage evidence into the
normalized envelope below, then invoke `ingest`. Harnesses expose different
boundaries, including thread/turn/item streams, lifecycle hooks, and persisted
session/agent/tool events. The core command therefore contains no provider
transcript parser or harness adapter. A host that cannot expose a measurement
records it as unavailable; it must not infer it from prose or substitute zero.

## Schema v2 envelope

Every normalized event contains the existing lifecycle envelope plus expanded
identity and explicit measurement provenance:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "runId": "stable run ID",
  "eventId": "stable event ID",
  "type": "transition or sample type",
  "timestamp": "RFC 3339 timestamp",
  "spanId": "stable span ID or null",
  "spanKind": "span category or null",
  "parentSpanId": "stable span ID or null",
  "blockingSpanIds": [],
  "identity": {
    "laneId": null,
    "decisionId": null,
    "issue": null,
    "pullRequest": null,
    "branch": null,
    "head": null,
    "sessionId": null,
    "segmentId": null,
    "toolName": null,
    "waitId": null,
    "model": null
  },
  "actor": {
    "kind": "coordinator | worker | watcher | tool | user",
    "capabilityClass": null
  },
  "context": {
    "mode": "isolated | recent-slice | full-history | coordinator",
    "exceptionDecisionId": null
  },
  "result": "started | succeeded | failed | pending | blocked | cancelled | unavailable",
  "blocker": null,
  "retryAt": null,
  "measurement": {
    "source": "host-owned source name",
    "streamId": "stable source stream ID",
    "sequence": 0,
    "mode": "delta | snapshot",
    "baseline": null
  },
  "usage": {
    "inferences": 1,
    "inputTokens": 100,
    "cachedInputTokens": 80,
    "uncachedInputTokens": 20,
    "outputTokens": 10,
    "reasoningTokens": 4,
    "compactions": 0,
    "unavailableFields": []
  },
  "resources": {
    "runnerMilliseconds": null,
    "agentMilliseconds": 2500,
    "toolCalls": 2,
    "commandMilliseconds": null,
    "effectiveWorkers": 1,
    "unavailableFields": [
      "runnerMilliseconds",
      "commandMilliseconds"
    ]
  }
}
```

Use a null `measurement` only for a lifecycle event with no measured values.
Every null usage or resource value must appear in its adjacent
`unavailableFields`; zero is a measured value. `session_started`,
`manual_resume`, `model_sample`, and `tool_sample` make session boundaries,
manual continuation, model usage, and tool usage explicit. Their matching
identity fields are required.

## Counter semantics

Measurement streams are keyed by `source` and `streamId`. Sequence numbers
start at zero and remain contiguous. A stream uses exactly one mode and one
baseline:

- `delta` values are increments and use a null baseline;
- `snapshot` values are cumulative and declare `zero` when the first sample is
  measured from zero, or `start` when the first sample establishes a baseline
  that is not part of this run's total;
- a decrease is an unexplained reset and invalidates the stream; start a new
  stream instead;
- missing baselines, sequence gaps, mixed modes, and changed baselines are
  invalid; and
- `effectiveWorkers` is a gauge summarized as minimum, maximum, and latest. It
  is never added to counters.

The summary reports session and segment identities, manual resumes, usage and
resource counters, gauges, per-model usage, per-tool and per-wait totals,
unavailable fields, non-aggregatable evidence, and source/stream provenance.
Schema-v1 lifecycle events remain readable. Their numeric values are listed as
non-aggregatable because v1 did not identify delta versus snapshot semantics or
the baseline; they never enter totals.

## Lifecycle and closure validation

Use explicit `span_started` and `span_finished` events with the same `spanId`,
`spanKind`, and identity for worker activity, coordinator work, local commands
or gates, CI, review, cooldown, decision wait, remediation, rework, restack,
merge, and genuine idle time. Add stable blocking relationships so later
analysis can distinguish critical-path, overlapping, and masked work.

Record run, lane, gate, push, CI, review, wait, retry, remediation, restack,
merge, rework, and run transitions when they occur. Pair
`decision_requested` and `decision_resolved` with one stable decision ID and
record policy-threshold checkpoints and interventions.

Before milestone closure, `validate` must succeed for the current `runId`.
Missing or conflicting IDs, invalid measurement streams, unclosed spans,
missing transition classes, silent nulls, and superseded work without a
terminal cancellation or explicit blocker remain invalid closure evidence.
Command and CI events retain their real command, workflow, run, and job
identities when the host exposes them. Elapsed wall time stays separate from
aggregate runner time, concurrent agent time, tool calls, inferences, and
tokens.
